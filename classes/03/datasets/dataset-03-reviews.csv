The reader does a fine job of differentiating all the multitudes of Ms. Rowlings\' characters and her intersecting, overlapping plot lines. Many characters had unlikable traits, but all of them were believable, and the intrigue of small town and school politics and prejudice seemed all too realistic. Don\'t read this one looking for a happy ending; some characters do well, some do despicable things, and some die in sad and, perhaps, inevitable circumstances. I picked this audiobook because I enjoyed the Harry Potter books. I knew Ms. Rowling could tell a good story. She did not let me down with this ""more adult"" novel. Good story.'",4.0

If I had another option, I probably would not have finished it. I really wanted to like this book. It deals with some very real issues and socioeconomic prejudices. Unfortunately, it felt like every person in this town was given a fatal flaw just so everyone could have one. In the end, I felt the purpose of the book was more about advancing a political agenda than advancing the plot. The plot was jerky and almost completely stalled at some points. I was NOT expecting Harry Potter as some other readers were, but I was expecting plot development. The book kept hinting of big secrets, and it fell flat. I'm giving it two because there were two characters (Terri and Krystal) that I felt were developed to a degree that their motivations made sense and I could feel empathy for their situations.

My mom thought magic etc was of the devil so I first read the series as a 16 year old who used her license to go to the library. I was enthralled (and continue to be) by that series. I always meant to read the Casual Vaccancy when it first came out but I was worried it would disappoint me having so loved her HP series. I knew about the bad reviews and maybe that did help that I didn't have the highest sense of anticipation when I actually read the book, but I had read and enjoyed all 3 of her Robert Galbraith novels and I decided it was time to read the Casaul Vaccancy. The premise isn't the most exciting I will give you that - an empty seat on a town council - and the characters and situations sometimes are unpleasant but they are so real and the characters become so real that you start to feel as though you live in Pagford watching all the drama unfold. It somewhat reminded me of Edith Wharton novels which are complicated and sometimes do not have a clear protagonist. The thing I enjoyed about Edith Wharton (I thought of Custom of the Country) and this novel is that despite the sometimes very grim nature of the books they make you FEEL. Books won't always make you feel happy about the outcome or the character but when books make you feel some emotion towards the characters that is job well done to me because that means the characters are developed enough that they become real to the reader.""",4.0

Characterization is, in my opinion, one of her strongest aspects as a writer, and it's incredible how she makes these characters so painfully human. She doesn't hold anything back in exploring their flaws, the hypocrisy that they don't even realize they are committing.

Any who have read one or more of the Harry Potter books knows that Rowling is expert at drawing finely developed characters, setting almost tangible scenes, and bringing the reader (in my case the listener, as I ""read"" this on audio CD) up close and personal with the characters.  As the book progresses, one feels increasingly drawn into the lives of the many characters. The author skillfully interweaves their lives in the most natural of ways.  The actor who read the audio version of this book was superb ... his vocal representations of the characters were so consistent that after a relatively short time, when a character was speaking, the  narrative didn\'t need to tell you who it was - the actor\'s voice made it very clear.

The parish council is divided; some members want to continue to support The Fields and others want to pass them off to neighboring Yarvil Parish.

She is rich (worth about 620m, according to Sky News, though one wonders how they can know). She is massively successful as a writer and generates plenty of jealousy (another writer once accused her of sucking the air out of the market, apparently).

With The Casual Vacancy, she has, once again, proved that very few authors can touch her astounding ability at doing just that.  Brutal in its realistic depiction of a small town and those who inhabit it, Rowling draws such fine, full, searing portraits of her characters.  Though at first, those portraits seem cold and harsh, Rowling infuses her characters with deeply touching (if also infuriating and disturbing) humanness.  One gets the sense that she knows these people intimately, and loves them despite their appalling failings and cowardice.  As a reader, I was shocked and disgusted by behavior that I hope I would myself never engage in, by thoughts I hope I myself would never entertain.  By sketching these people and their failings so fully and honestly, though, Rowling forces us, though we might pass judgement on the inhabitants of Pagford and Yarvil, to confront the bits of ourselves that are familiar in these people.'",5.0

The characters' lives kept the pages turning even though their conflicts were mostly petty and often downright stupid, but it's those kinds of people who believe their issues supercede everyone else's. The lives of the downtrodden don't matter even though those people to whom the small-town and small-minded people turn up their noses have the most real problems. Like reality, their outcomes don't fare well at all. Also like reality, the harsh underbelly of racism and classism remain virtually unchanged and almost unnoticeable if it weren't for Rowling's omniscient glimpse into the ugliest minds of the most seemingly banal of characters.""",4.0

I selected the book because of the author, decided to read it because of the cover jacket description and continued reading to the end because I wanted to see how it ended and I wanted to get a picture of British village life. I was not making Harry Potter comparisons at any time. I am able to compartmentalize my expectations and took this book on its own merit. That being said, it was difficult for me to make it through the book. The numerous characters were hard to keep straight until almost half way through. Once I thought I had them sorted, the story became easier to follow and I did develop feelings, good and bad, for some of the characters. I would not recommend this book except as a look into the way villagers live from day to day as they struggle to find their place in the scheme of their world. I saw another review that mentioned Peyton Place and that was my first thought on completing the book as I reviewed my reaction. That characters have few redeeming qualities and the ones they do exhibit do not seem strong enough to be a permanent part of their substance. They have moments of ethical or moral behavior but can't seem to maintain it and fall back into old habits. Almost as if the reason they behave ethically is not because it is the right thing to do but because they have considered how others will perceive their action. Perhaps that is not far from the mark.""",2.0

The shifting perspectives allows an insight into different points of view, creating multifaceted, interesting characters. I hated and loved all of them. By about halfway through this book I was having trouble putting it down and upon finishing it was left with a powerful ache and a new perspective. This book is probably not for everyone, and I can see how many a HP fan would be disappointed and bewildered. This book is JK doing something very different.

This is a brilliant book which illustrates Rowling's true empathy and understanding of human nature; it illustrates without cliche what makes us all different and what makes us all similar.  Some of the rough and disadvantaged characters in the novel are probably as complete polar opposites of Rowling as could be possible in behavior and social status, but she is able to create characters whom you are simultaneously sympathetic with and repelled by.  Rowling understands people, all kinds of them; and she is not a snob...that much is clear from the book.  I could not put this book down and I truly enjoyed getting to know these characters; they are beautifully well-drawn and the book contains a lot of humor in spots which balances out some of the tragic and negative aspects of the story.  Rowling has me now as a devoted fan and I will continue to read her novels...she is now writing a series of mysteries which began with 'The Cuckoo's Calling' and I truly hope she will write more novels akin to 'The Casual Vacancy'.""",5.0

The characters are all flawed, as is humanity. Some are seriously ill, mentally or physically. Some are well off; others are poor, living in deplorable conditions. Rowling's cast is varied and large; it isn't always easy to keep track of them, and most aren't likable enough for readers to form sentimental attachments to them.

Clearly she can write and this book shows that she has some pretty great range beyond the Potterverse. I liked the butterfly effect concept that runs through it, the notion that one event triggers off a sequence that flows through the rest of the story. I thought the characters were pretty engaging for the most part although I thought a few didn't bring much to the table and some were a little one-dimensional (why did we need Maureen?  she isn't very relevant and only kind of becomes marginally significant at the end).  The whole Gavin character was a little baffling too other than she felt like we needed a character who pretty much always gets things wrong.  The one thing I did not expect from the book was that it, for me, was a gut punch throughout.  Some reviews thought this was black comedy or tragicomedy but I didn't feel like the humorous scenes balanced the drama and tragedy that runs from the first chapter on.  I did like the small town where everyone is out to ruin everyone angle.  That was an intriguing point and how all politics is local.  Some reviewer called this book 500 pages of socialist propaganda.  That just made me giggle.  I think you know what you're going to get with Rowling now that she has enough money to own the planet so didn't really get why they were so upset (assume this was all about the clinic and how the town was trying to turn its back on the Fields).""",4.0

But then I began to recall what it was like to feel as helpless as Krystal Weedon and as terrified of ending up like Terri Weedon, before  I found a teacher who cared enough to help me surmount my dyslexia (thanks, Mr. Miller!) and later professors from the lower classes  who spent the time with me I needed to learn to solve problem with words. Rowling is cruel to the cruel and speaks for those who can't write books.  She deeply explores what the loss of Barry Fairbrother, who thought everyone was at least as valuable as he was, does to a community of smug, selfish, judgmental, over-privileged creeps.  And it's balm for the soul of everyone who has ever had to contend with similar communities.  If you feel sick with anger when you see the top 10% pinching up their faces in distaste as they step over the homeless lying in the street on their way into boutiques and expensive cafes, then you'll enjoy this cathartic novel.

Conflicts that have been simmering under the surface for years come to a head with the unexpected death of a councilman, leading to a ""casual vacancy"" on the council. The factions on the council are divided over the perceived drain on resources by the subsidized housing community (the Fields) just outside of the town. Whereas Barry, the deceased man, rose from poverty in the Fields to a comfortable middle class experience, others are convinced that is a blight on their community. At the center of the story is Krystal, a kind of anti-heroine, a teenager trying to take care of her toddler brother and her in and out of rehab for heroin mother. She had been taken under Barry\'s wing as a member of the rowing team. While far from an angel, Krystal has a tragic air of trying to do the right thing but failing despite her good intentions. As the politics become nastier, we see how the families are affected and how small things can erupt into terrible consequences. While I agree with some of the other reviewers that the dark and gritty nature of the novel can sometimes be over the top and is certainly a big departure from the Harry Potter series, it is a shot of reality, and you can see Rowling\'s depth of character development and storytelling in spite of the modern and ""real"" tone.

I get it that it's a trend these days for authors to write each new book in a different style, but I must ask, Why? This might have made it as a short story. The writing is blocky, trudging, decidedly pedestrian. Every now and then there is a funny moment, a witty observation, an incisive scene, as when the social worker tries to interview the junkie mother with the hungry toddler running around in wet diapers, risking his life as he fights the already entrenched negligence.

This book is brilliant in it's depiction of human nature, including the ugly side of it. But for Harry Potter fans, I warn you, this is not at all a fantasy and is not the feel good novel that her Harry Potter series often was. Instead this book is a work of literary fiction that exposes the petty behavior and apathy of a small town, full of fairly affluent middle class people, towards a community of impoverished people on their border. Rowling has created a story that most people could see unfolding everyday outside their own doors, if only they would stop and really look. Her characters are totally believable, but not necessarily likable (though there are a few that I liked). These are flawed people, but they have their moments of revelation and introspection that lead a few to rethink their way of living. But at it's core, like Harry Potter, this is a novel about tolerance, understanding, courage, and love. It just isn't shown through rose colored glasses.""",4.0

After reading A Casual Vacancy, I have to say that while the story may not be everyone\'s cup of tea (as another review said, ""if you wanted something funny or magical then head to the another genre section"")  I have to give JK Rowling some props for her first stab at writing for adults.

JK Rs narration is effortless; dry British humor emerges but is restrained. Rowling boldly strips her characters to their sullied souls and makes the reader acutely aware of her penetrating literary eye. I dont think she wrote this book on her train trips but I sense that this plot was brewing in her mind for sometime perhaps since childhood. She is a wizard at creating adolescent characters. They are painted with so much finesse that you can touch and feel their blemishes, insecurities; false sense of bravado, odd alliances and stark rebellion. There is probably a bully like Fats in any school and a silently suffering victim like Sukhvinder. There is no protagonist but one is left feeling deeply for the rough and tough, Krystal daughter of a drug-addict mother who tries hard to beat dire poverty and the odds stacked up against her but fails miserably.

The immediate revelation is that this book is not Harry Potter 8, it's not fantasy or teen fiction, it's harrowing literary fiction that delves deep into human nature, and through a cast of diverse and intelligently-constructed characters, shows how all of us can be led to resent our fellow humans. The plot is somewhat threadbare, which is fine; it develops in much the same way a season of Mad Men does, with the bulk of the material exploring and developing the characters and showing us the facets of their personalities, before presenting two satisfying climaxes near the end where, finally, the stakes are raised for these characters and we glimpse them in their most vulnerable states. The characters in the book are very strong; Fats, Gaia, Suhkvinder, and Andrew have replaced the main trio from Harry Potter as my favorite Rowling teenage characters. Reading their subplots makes me wish that Harry Potter had had more swearing and sex, because Rowling masterfully portrays these adolescents without resorting to hyperbole or cliche, and it would've been awesome to see a Rated R conversation between Harry and Draco or Ron and Hermione instead of the PG talk of the Harry Potter series. If there's a weak link in the cast, it's the character of the Weedons. I won't spoil their placement in the society of Pagford, but after 400 pages it was slightly tiresome to keep coming back to them in the exact same position that they'd always been in when I was more interested in the development of the rest of the characters. However, the Weedons feature heavily in the finale and this makes up for it somewhat. The book is well-written, will make you exercise the dictionary function on your Kindle unless your vocabulary is much stronger than mine, and will alternatively make you bust up laughing with Rowling's dry, dark sense of humor, and cry for the characters, not with artificial tragedy (of which there's a little bit in this book) but because Rowling makes them so achingly human that you can't help sympathize yet be annoyed by them at the same time.

It reminded me, in a way, of Richard Russo's books in the way it takes a town and examines it and its inhabitants closely, never really feeling the need to desire to stray from the town's borders.  Everything, and everyone, the book needs is within the town's reach.  The book touches on lots of issues, some pretty and some not - poverty, disease, snobbery, politics, education to name a few.  It also takes a deep dive into a number of the characters' lives and examines the realities of every day life:  a man frozen by his fears, a woman held captive to her bad taste in men and her constant belief that she'll get her fairy-tale ending, an essentially good kid destroyed by the poverty and lack of guidance surrounding her, parents utterly unaware of the life their children lead, petty people effecting small cruelties that their small lives permit them.  It also beautifully illustrates how fundamentally one person can touch so many lives and cause a town to literally unravel when he passes away.  This is the stuff of life, and sometimes it is ugly, and petty - and sometimes beautiful and soaring.  We get to go along for the ride as people get sick and heal, succeed and fail, rise and fall.  By the end of the book, I really cared about some of the characters - and really disliked others for their smallness and cruelty.

2013-12-20,R1WBT0N6P80WTG,b'zagain',b'The Casual Vacancy',"b""In the Casual Vacancy, Rowling turns her attention away from the wizard world of Harry Potter to the more adult focused small community of Pagford  where everyone knows everyone else.  The community is in the midst of a small civil war among its elected representatives as lines have been drawn between two sides who are debating whether or not the town should rid itself of the responsibility of a local housing project (called The Fields) and a connected drug treatment facility.  Readers of the Potter series will recognize Rowling's writing style in which she does an excellent job of handling multiple characters and weaving together several subplots in to the main direction of the novel.  Interestingly, there are some other parallels to her earlier work.  Like the Potter series which focused on a central dynamic figure, Harry, who the others rallied around, The Casual Vacancy has its own central player in Barry Fairbrother, the primary leader of the pro-Fields movement and an integral player in the lives of all the primary characters.  In an interesting twist, however (which is far from a spoiler), Barry dies suddenly in the first few pages of the novel, leaving the other characters to adapt and struggle with his absence.  While Barry departs the book early, his presence remains felt throughout the plot.  The elements of the book at times seem reminiscent of a soap opera with the various intrigues of the characters, however, it is an engaging story that is helped along by Rowling's solid style.  Overall, a good novel that falls a bit short of her previous (and astoundingly popular) works.""",3.0

Rowling created well rounded characters and intertwined them beautifully.

I enjoyed seeing the characters evolve, even though it took them, especially the adults, to the END of the book to make positive changes.  I found the story line very real and dealing with issues that are happening in todays world.  I read that many of the reviewers found it too dark and depressing, and felt that J. K.

I will agree that those looking to read this book in hopes of a Harry Potter-ish type of read are going to be disappointed, as this books focus is much more sociological in nature. However; those familiar with Ms. Rowling's writing style will not be disappointed with this book, as she does a very good job of providing a casual flowing interaction between the characters in the book (much like she did with the characters in the Harry Potter series).

The best example of this is the Weedon family, with all the attempts at West Country accents on paper.

Rowling takes a long time (the first half of the book) setting the stage for the action that comes in the second half.  But, having now read the entire book, the first half is justified.  At its core, I think that The Casual Vacancy is a character study.  Rowling is delving deep into the human heart and the human condition.  She doesn't paint a rosy picture of humanity (she didn't in Harry Potter, either, by the way).  Instead, she is candid in revealing a portion of humanity as it is: fallen, flawed, often limited by circumstance, and self-centered.  Rowling takes the time necessary to explain and examine the human beings she portrays.  These character examinations make up much of the first half of the book.  I think the difficulty in starting this book and staying with it is the lack of focus on plot in the first half of the book.  In the end, that's a great thing.""",5.0

Million army of fans was ready to buy Hogwarts library books, the tales of beedle the bard, and the foresaken Harry Potter encyclopedia that will never appear, unfortunately. So what does she do? She destroys that brand by going in completely different niche. From childish, teen type of a book that actually suited perfectly even adults into some dirty and nasty book that made me vomit. It is like, if Maybach started to produce Smart type of cars from tomorrow. Totally illogical, nonsense. Who is she now? What can we expect from her? Another adult book that depicts the ugly parts of our lives? Instead of being number one in the teen niche of the book shops, she digged a grave for her name and her brand. It does not matter whether you liked or not the book so much. It matters that Rowling moved into another direction. It is up to you to like it or not. However, it is utterly disappointing that the possibility of seeing HP like books is vanishing year by year. And who else, if not Rowling, could give us those magical hours of reading and rereading the book?  Excuse me, but there are thousand of writers in the same adult genre and if I want something more realistic and criminalistic, I will 100% find a good book in the nearest book shop.

Brice',b'Worth the Effort',"b""A Casual Vacancy is structured like a Victorian novel: many characters written in the omniscient point of view so that the author can slip in and out of the minds of each character. The book is complex and multilayerd. JKR begins with the death of Barry Fairbrother, a councilman in the small down of Pagford. His death causes ripples to move through the cauldron of pettiness that is Pagford revealing the truth behind the facades of many of the most prominent members of the community. This book comes the closest of any I've read in years of replicating the experience of being a psychotherapist, of learning what most lives are really about behind their appearances. JKR's psychological acumen is outstanding, especially when portraying the dynamics between prominent hypocritical parents and their mostly dramatically disturbed offspring. In the character of Simon Price, she presents the best depiction of a malignant narcissist I've ever read. The first 60-80 pages are difficult because the author presents many characters (reminiscent of Richard Russo) and the reader must work to keep them straight, but the labor involved is more than richly rewarded. I'm afraid that the books mixed reviews are coming from reviewers (even from some of our most prominent newspapers) who simply don't want to spend the time on complex novels that can't be speed read. God knows what these reviewers would have done with Dostoevsky or Tolstoy. They certainly lose patience with other brilliant authors - Murakami, for instance. Anyway, A Casual Vacancy is a brilliant novel, worthy of the woman who created the Potter series.""",5.0

2013-08-17,R1ZB480O3OE69S,b'Cloggie Downunder',b'a brilliant read.',"b""The Casual Vacancy is the first adult novel by popular British author, J.K.Rowling. This contemporary fiction is set in the seemingly idyllic English village of Pagford, where the sudden death of Parish Councillor, Barry Fairbrother creates a casual vacancy on the parish council. As subsequent events are narrated from the points of view of various different characters, the picture emerges of a village whose inhabitants are not all satisfied with their lot in life, a village of simmering tensions waiting to boil over. Rowling's characters are easily recognisable as the denizens of the typical English village, but at the same time, show individual depth and appeal (or repugnance, as the case may be). And it seems quite a few of the characters have a secret (or two). The setting, characters and events will resonate with readers, and these same happenings drive the characters to desperate actions that ultimately result in tragedy for some. Rowling manages to pack quite a lot into this novel: she has an obese megalomaniac, drug addicts, computer-savvy teens, a fawning wife, a violent husband and father, an anxious teacher, and a caring social worker, to name just a few. There is domestic violence, rape, racism, corruption, self-mutilation, bullying, gossip, teen pregnancy, child abuse and SQL injection. But if this sounds depressing, it is relieved by the underlying black humour that fills the novel.  This all comes together to make a brilliant read.""",5.0

Barree',b'Anthony Trollop redux',"b""In the tradition of Anthony Trollope, Rowlings develops a seemingly simple situation in small town goverment into a full blown drama.  The story evolves from the various characters' reactions to the sudden death of Barry Fairweather, a man who provided support and stabilzation for many of his fellow citizens. As the story unfolds, these individuals' backgrounds and feelings are revealed.  While some unravel to the point of crash and burn, there are those whose dignity is preserved or restored. I particularly enjoyed the author's technique of revealing, largely through internal monologue, the inner lives and feelings of not only the adults but the adolescents of the town.""",4.0

She seemed to have dispensed with her skill to engage the reader into a main character, but trust me, she pulls it off in a most backdoor fashion. The characters are flawed, human, and eventually... vivid. Only well into the book, do we get the insights and compassion we have seen in good ole Harry & company. It\'s a side of life we don\'t usually seek out for casual escapist reading. Nearly half the book is spent in giving us the seamy side of her characters before she lifts the veil and we see beneath the sheen of their delusions of themselves. In the end, they recover some deeper introspection to their attempts to appear perfect. This is not a perfect world. It is a world of ""work in progress"" and a messy business it is. I find myself assessing how giving and caring I\'ve been and will become, as this book distills itself in the trickle down aftermath of reading. It\'s a tough read and poignant to the point of painful, but Rowling always takes the higher ground, bringing depths to the most vile, uncovering the twists of fate that created the Snapes and Vordemorts. Even our beloved Dumledore emerged with flaws. In ""Casual Vacancy"" we come to know the deceased Barry Fairbrother through his profound influence on others\' lives.

Only one or two adults do you have any sympathy for in the entire book (and one of them dies at the beginning). The rest of the adult population seem to be line drawings of what is wrong with humanity --- delusional expectations, overwhelming desires to escape from reality, self-righteousness, narcissism, corruption, drug addiction, me-me-me-me. It just doesn't strike true that an entire book could be made up of such a sorry lot of humanity. The kids do come off slightly better and are definitely given a range of emotions, struggles and shades of depth. However, again, the person you are holding out hope for also dies.

Unfortunately, this is so over the top as to be equivalent to Emma Watson becoming a hardcore porn star to prove that she's a big girl now. This book is so dreadfully overdone it's difficult to read. Character after character is one-dimensional and completely self-deluded. Yes, I know all humans are flawed and that we all have faults that could be put under a microscope. Rowling seems to believe that every single person is nothing but flaws utterly without redeeming characteristics. If she intended this effect, this is a terribly cynical and simplistic novel; if she instead intended to provide some positive character traits and complex personalities then she failed miserably and the book was poorly written. Either way, characters this uniformly bad and, well, uniform, cannot amount to a good story.""",2.0

I have read all of the HP books and have a ton of collection of novels from the same author.  If I like something someone has written, I'm fairly likely to pick up his/her next book.  So it wasn't a stretch to read a 'different' book from Rowling.  I certainly wasn't expecting it to be anything like Harry Potter in the sense that there would be magic, fantasy or separate worlds.  I did however expect magic - as in being transported into an enchanting town and mesmerized by the interweaving of the character's lives.  I was therefore disappointed because there were far too many characters and they were rather flat.  Krystal Weedon was someone I was truly pulling for because her life was so truly depressing.  She was the underdog and unfortunately, stayed that way.  Simon Price? Omgoodness I wanted so badly to see his true demise and his family get even with him.  Since I'd been very pleased with the majority of the Harry Potter books, the content, the growth of characters and their emotional register, I was disappointed by this book and the writing in general.

It's quite a departure from the fun and exciting world of Harry Potter. This story focuses on the lives of 20 or so people in a small town in England and how they are all affected by the passing of a beloved town councilman. The thing you'll notice first about the book is how much more violent and sexual it is than expected. The story starts off rather slow and may confuse some because it goes through the process of introducing us to each of the main characters. This takes up the first third of the book or so. While I was reading the first third, it didn't seem like there was much of a story to tell. The main plot doesn't really set into motion until the middle of the book, and then it becomes very interesting. The second half becomes exciting and sad, and it expands greatly on the connections between all the main characters. This makes having so many characters confusing for some, but when Rowling goes further into their lives, you will be impressed by how well thought out and well-handled the characters are. Ultimately, this isn't a book for people who need happy endings, or a book for people wanting the next Harry Potter.

Now that I am almost finished, I have nothing but praise for her literary efforts. She has very cleverly taken an ordinary life situation in small-village England and turned it into an affair that packs a lot of energy balanced by an equal amount of pathos. The town of Yarvil has never really generated a lot love within its ranks, simply because its members would rather hate than help each other. There is no civil behavior here, especially when the future of the town is at stake and about to be settled in a by-election for a seat on the parish council, vacated by the sudden death of a popular teacher-advocate. There is a piece of land that is currently being used as the home of a popular drug rehab program, which has now come to the attention of a group who want to sell it for housing development. While the campaign heats up, all the innocence that we come to associate with backwater England disappears. There is a fair spate of nastiness in this story because its citizens don't empathize very well with the needs of its more vulnerable citizens - a generation of young druggies who are going through the rigors of rehab. To keep this novel current, Rowlings introduces the Internet as that weapon that will be used by both sides to wreck the other's chance of winning. In the end, all the political mudslinging will lead to disastrously unintended consequences. Someone who has no interest in dirty politics will lose bigtime only because she can't cope with the changes this vote will bring to her fragile life.""",4.0

I quite disagree, there were parts of the book I very much enjoyed reading. It is because of this I call it ""OK"" rather than saying I outright disliked it. The problems inherent to the story are that it\'s just not very well written. I adored the Harry Potter books and thought that it was marvelous to have the chance to watch a writer grow in confidence over the course of a series--the books went from being relatively awkwardly paced but wonderfully imagined (the first), to confident, detailed, gripping, well-plotted texts. None of this confidence is on display in this novel. Full of point of view lapses that may be failed attempts to move the story cinematically but end up making the writing seem a touch amateurish, the story is ponderous, riddled with holes, and leaves a lot of the more powerful ideas it sets up early on unresolved or unexplored before ending predictably, leaving the reader lost as to the intent of the tale. As the novel unfolds, it becomes more of an understated soap opera than a piece of literary fiction. It\'s unfortunate, as the book starts wonderfully, creating a vividly painted imagery of the town the book is set up to study, but then relies on cliched character and setting work that, in the end, tells more of a non-story than that fascinating one it promised from the start.'",3.0

I knew it was an adult book and not intended for children but it is as though Ms Rowling set out to prove that in spite of her previous wonderful books she can write one that is as depressed and depressing as she is.  The book is a bloodbath of death, dark events, the foulest of language (how can a WOMAN so casually and frequently use a nasty word that denigrates all women???). There is not one happy person or one happy event in it and it rapidly sucks all the joy out of the reader. Most of the characters die, including an innocent child. It is not just gritty, but grimy. All the characters hate one another, cheat on one another, kill or want to kill one another, and there is no humor or lightness of tone anywhere in it.  I\'m glad I only rented the CD set and didn\'t give her very much of my money for producing this kind of writing.  I knew it was an adult book but I wasn\'t prepared for it to be an expression of Ms. Rowling\'s ongoing clinical depression.  Good literature raises one up and inspires one to greatness; it doesn\'t drag one down into mud and guts and misery like this book.  Skip it altogether until she writes a decent one, and read one of the pieces of great literature that explore the development of GOOD character and have exciting, rewarding plots, like ""Shane"" or ""Rebecca"". Neither of these have happy endings, but they are well written, well plotted, and well developed.

JK Rowling has done a superb job of looking below the pretty, peaceful surface of the village of Pagford, and has shown it is really a seething cauldron of interacting characters, who attack, take advantage of, and support one another in a variety of ways.  And, the touch at the end, where Howard Mollison\'s favorite song ""The Green, Green, Grass of Home"" in which a man awakes to find his homecoming to his lovely old home town was nothing but a dream, and the reality is that this is the last morning of his life on death row, is a beautifully done touch as a foreshadowing of what will happen next.

I stopped after the first 50 pages, skipped through and read the final few pages. Unfortunately it ends as dismally as it starts. Perhaps her muse fled after Harry.

Superficially, the book is about the vacuum left in the townspeople's lives when a relatively young town councillor suddenly dies.  More profoundly, the book is about how people affect one another, sometimes for good, sometimes for bad.  Many of the scenes are painfully sad because they are so honest.

Some reviews said how shallow the characters were, but I found them to be just the opposite. Her characters are deep and well written. If you find the characters dull, then you will not like this book. The characters are the book. The plot seems secondary - just a framework for these characters to operate in. JK Rowling tackles a lot of serious issues in this book. I've seen other reviewers list the myriad of issues to support a negative opinion - how it was unbelievable that so many heavyweight topics were squeezed into one book. Looking at it that way, I see the point. Rowling covers death, addiction, self mutilation, rape, mental illness, poverty... geeze it sure does sound like an after school special.

I needed to say that first, because it's hard to write a positive review about a novel where characters are so flawed and difficult, especially when there's nothing flashy about their story.  I understand that when the stakes seem so low (a small town council seat) people compare them to the Good and Evil stakes of the Harry Potter books and find them wanting, but as happens in dismissive reviews of many of women writers who attempt this kind of novel, that seems like such stereotypical and lazy criticism.  How people live their daily lives is where it all starts.  How people express their compassion (or not) through local politics, through family politics, through personal whims and desires -- that's the basis for where we end up as a society.  The society Rowling presents is indeed petty and unforgiving (and at many instances unforgivable) yet why is showing it on a more personal level not praiseworthy?  Rowling takes on big topics -- various kinds of familial abuse, drug addiction, bullying -- from an everyday perspective, describing even the most unlikeable characters with both charity and open eyes.  She's especially good (no surprise) at getting into the minds of her teenage subjects, and unlike the mostly black-and-white characters of the Harry Potter books, these are kids I recognize, with complex motivations.  The crimes are (mostly) small-time and the acts of heroism are baby steps, but what can I say? it all rang true for me.

Rowling deftly weaves between characters, helping the reader understand their usually misguided and often malevolent actions. I greatly enjoyed this book, even though it was strange reading some of the mildly graphic descriptions and vulgar dialogue. These are not two things that normally upset me, but as a long-time Harry Potter fan, it was strange to read them from the woman who wrote the books that I grew up with.

When this book came out, I was naturally curious to see what direction Rowling had taken after the sensational success of the Potter series.  This book is very different from Potter.  Whereas every sentence in a Potter book drew you deeper into the magical world of fantasy that Rowling had intricately woven, The Casual Vacancy was a gritty and unflinching glimpse into the reality of some people's lives.  The book is slow to pick up and most of the characters are loathsome and unforgiveably self-absorbed. The only sympathetic characters are the dead Barry Fairbrother, the tragic anti-heroine Krystal and the mostly invisible wallflower Sukvinder. Living in the stiflingly idyllic hamlet of Pagford with a gaggle of contemptuous sociopaths seems a bit like torture.  In the end, I was almost happy that Fairbrother was already dead, that Krystal was finally put out of her misery and hoping that Sukvinder's newly discovered confidence leads her to get out of there as soon as she can.""",3.0

The worst part is, I am American and every single one of my most favorite novels were written by a British person...in the 1800's...and I still couldn't stand this book.  JK Rowling wrote the seedy side of people very well, she is an excellent writer...however, it appears she pushed this book out as not to be known as a 'one hit wonder' as it were due to Harry Potter's fame...however, she really diminished herself with this book.  Sorely disappointed.  I cannot stress enough how hard it is to make it through this story, because it is painfully dull.  Be warned, I believe a lot of people forced themselves to like this book because of its author not on its merit. TERRIBLE BOOK and not worth the money....trust me...if you 'must' have it for a personal collection wait for it to go on clearance...and even then $5 is still too steep a price to pay for it.""",1.0

The book draws you in and gets you invested in these characters, despite the fact that none of them are very likable. That was actually what I found most surprising about this book. You have this cast of characters that all are either terrible people or woefully flawed, and you still are rooting for them and want to keep reading to see what is going to happen. I didn\'t want the book to end. It\'s one of those books that could just keep going and going, since it\'s not really about very much to begin with.

It's magic can be found in her uncanny ear for dialogue, her wonderful wit, and her mastery of the details of everyday life.

The first few chapters touch on the rather mundane topic of a vacancy of the parish (i.e., town) council. I wondered how on earth she was going to sustain this premise for an entire novel. However, I became so involved in the tragi-comic lives of the characters (who are NOT difficult to keep track of) that I wished the book would go on for many more chapters.

These people live at the lower levels of the economic and social scale and their stories are not the stuff of magic and adventure.

2013-02-13,RSRMDG9LXV0F5,b'Josh Mauthe',"b'Set aside your expectations and savor this cynical, heart-breaking, honest look at the world'","b""It's best to put aside any preconceptions you might have about what The Casual Vacancy will be like before you read it. That's hard to do in any situation, but when the author is J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, that's even more so; no matter what, you'll have certain expectations or ideas about what The Casual Vacancy might be like. It's to Rowling's credit, I think, that the book defies almost any expectation anyone had, delivering not a genre book, not a light-hearted book, but a cynical, dark look at modern society, politics, poverty, strained family relationships, and more. Nominally, The Casual Vacancy is about the aftermath of a death in a small English town, a death which opens up a seat on the ruling body in the town (the titular vacancy). But in reality, Rowling uses the death as a way to open up this insular world and its dramas for the reader to explore. Rowling's working with a sprawling cast of characters here, and her effortless gliding between perspectives, dialects, philosophies, and thoughts is just one of the many joys for someone like me who was curious how her prose would differ as she took on the adult world. Indeed, Rowling's prose and craft is generally superb, weaving between the past and present, sliding between characters, and juggling dozens of plot threads only to collide them at unexpected moments - it's a masterful performance from a technical perspective, and left me impressed with just how far Rowling had come from the first Potter novel so many years ago. The subject matter has been more problematic for some people, with some feeling lost in just how ferociously cynical and vicious The Casual Vacancy can be. While Rowling has created dozens of rich characters, none of them are heroes, and not one is without a flaw - sometimes, there are a multitude of them. That's led some to discount the book as being without likeable characters, which is an absurd charge to me; while there are no doubt some despicable people here, it's not hard to feel that Rowling has a surprising amount of empathy for all of them (albeit some more than others). Similarly, the subject matter here can be dark, but that's appropriate; with much of the book revolving around the town's effort to rid itself of the government housing for the poor and the drug clinic that's helping many escape their addictions, it would be absurd and offensive to minimize the suffering and difficulty that comes along with such a life. Instead, Rowling focuses beautifully on both sides, attempting to understand those who look down on the inhabitants of the projects while also attempting to be a voice for those who had no chance at anything better. If you take The Casual Vacancy as, in effect, a debut novel, you'll be deeply impressed; while there are no doubt a few missteps (for example: there's a subplot about hacking that feels a bit repetitive and a bit like a deus ex machina, and occasionally the massive cast gets a bit overwhelming and confusing), what you have here is an assured, confident step into the literary world. Rowling is taking a huge gamble here, trading her genre work in for something more literary, trading her hopefulness in for brutal realism, and focusing a lot on the many ways that human beings can find themselves lacking in empathy for even those they love. The end result is a fantastic novel, one that I read pretty much any time I had free moments, and one that hit me pretty hard as it came to its powerful climax. It's not often enough that novelists are willing to write about social classes and the conflicts between them, or the way that politics can obscure our basic humanity towards each other, and yet Rowling takes both issues on, all while spinning tales about parents and children, the way we cope with loss, and so much more. For its short length, The Casual Vacancy is an ambitious, complex novel, but it's also a very human one underneath that - and to me, that may be the most important thing.""",5.0

And instead of a man being shown the difference his life had made, here the other characters see how different life turns out to be when he is no longer part of the equation in village life and politics. Unlike a Harry Potter tale, there is no hero being groomed to sacrifice himself and destroy the arch-villain, and, indeed, there is no arch-villain.

Though set in a small village somewhere in England, the situations and personalities could be anywhere. The ulterior motives and the quick  and partial judgement people put on each other is a universal case. The story is so revealing in its analysis of human personalities that it leaves you with a sense of wanting to understand in your own life what drives you and everyone around you  and what is it that they are thinking beyond the obvious.

I even decided to purchase the Kindle version to avoid paying 25 dollars for the hardcover. I began reading it during a flight to Costa Rica and subsequent downtime on the vacation. I wasn't immediately impressed. The plot seemed so-so and the abundance of characters was really annoying. However, as the novel progressed, I found myself more and more drawn to the characters and their individual (but intertwining) stories. It didn't take long to get me hooked. Rowling does a great job with character development, as well as building the ever-present suspense. Despite what I'd initially thought, none of the eighteen or so main characters ended up seeming superfluous. I cried, laughed, and thought about the book for awhile after finishing it.

But essentially it's about the seedy underbelly of a seemingly idyllic small town in rural England. Everyone knows each other's business, and the people are all pretty dysfunctional. The characters are all hopelessly flawed and each is struggling with untold amounts of baggage and difficulty. There are at least a dozen protagonists, yet all are intricately developed and all but a couple are extremely sympathetic. I loved it because all of the subplots are delicately interwoven, the characters are round and complex, the writing is skillful, and the harsh reality of it all was somehow immensely satisfying to lose myself in for awhile. There's some vulgarity in it, and it's probably not for everyone, but I absolutely loved it. (By the way, not that it matters, but I'm also a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter series, and while some people are strangely bothered by Rowling's venture into adult lit., I can't help but feeling that it's silly to be bothered by that - there are TONS of authors who write both adult and kid lit.

That determination came from the name on the front cover. I am extremely disappointed in my lack of praise of this novel for I had been enthusiastic about it leading up to its release. The main problem was that with the introduction of so many characters it took a long time to become engulfed in the story (perhaps a map of all the characters at the beginning or end may have helped). The use of overt sexual references felt pretentious, like Rowling was trying to distance herself intentionally from her previous audience without adding much to the story. Like Rowling is so good at, she wound the web between the characters brilliantly, but her need to prove that she is not a one-trick-pony backfired. One of my biggest disappointments is that she wasted time working on this novel when she could have brought us another classic from the world of Harry Potter. I wasn\'t looking for Magic in the novel, but I was expecting the Magical way in which Rowling writes. There were moments when I detected her voice, but mostly, I just was itching to finish and get to the next novel.

""The Casual Vacancy"" is  a story of a small, but snobby, English village in which a village council member drops dead with an aneurysm or stroke (I can\'t remember which).  Of course he must be replaced as quickly as possible as not to disrupt governance.  In the ensuing days the citizens of the village show their true colors and reveal their allegiance to one ""side"" or another.  They also show their class-conscieniouness and pettishness.  To add to the mess, the neighboring village is lower-middle-class whom the uppity citizens may look down upon.  The lower class village does provide crime, drug use and addiction, and vulgar behavior.  Of course there is overlap between between the villages.  ""The Casual vacancy"" is somewhat enlightening as to the workings of the British class system.

What I did not get from the review was the amount of profanity and sexual subject matter. I could not count the number of times the ""f"" word was used, as well as others. Even if this is the way the characters would talk in ""real life"", the omniscient author can use other words and let the reader use their own imagination. I did not need these words to understand the despair or anger the characters felt. One of the reasons I like children\'s fiction is that because the author can\'t use profanity, or perhaps uses only mild profanity, they must have a broader vocabulary to describe emotions. Liberal use of profanity I think is often used as a crutch. While appreciating the social and personal issues of the characters, I was not interested in reading about their sexual issues in explicit terms. So, I was disappointed with the book. As soon as I finished it (I did care about the fates of the characters) I took it to a second-hand book shop for resale, and gave the proceeds to charity.

Now, I realize that Ms. Rowling may have been attempting to accurately depict her characters, but I really felt the use of bad language was more than gratuitous, and that it was filler for lack of more plot or character development.  Does all of lower class England curse non-stop? My second largest problem with the book was that ALL of the characters were extremely difficult to like. Even with the more sympathetic characters, you had barely a glimmer of understanding of their point of view before you found yourself not caring about them again a moment later.  The only character that I liked was the dead guy (Not giving anything away there, as that happens in the 1st chapter.)

She hit it out of the park.  One of my favorite kinds of books--complex, varied and interesting characters, and a draw-you-in narrative.  It is a pleasure to read a book that keeps you on your toes to pay attention to all the little details.  I am not the biggest fan of mysteries, but I love Ruth Rendell for the same reason.  Neither of these ladies dummy anthing down for the reader.  Every little detail is important as well as interesting.She portrays small town life with deadly accuracy, revealing all the petty (and not so petty) dealings that people have with each other.  A perfect example of the big fish in a small bowl theory.  I laughed, I cried and I hated it to end.  No novel is perfect, but this one was pretty darn close.

What I found is a novel that seems to be written for the sole purpose of shock value.  It is a complete departure from the writing style, symbolism, and wholesomeness of her previous works.  The only point I see in this book at all is that Rowling wants to distance herself as far away from the HP novels as possible in an effort to avoid being pigeon holed.  If that was her purpose, she has succeeded.  I found the plot\'s cohesiveness to be lacking.  The story has a very confusing start with introducing characters with very little connection to each other.  Over time there is some connection, but as a whole the plot and characters are not developed enough despite the staggering amount of pages in this novel.  The last couple of chapters seem to be hurriedly wrapping things up so that the book can have an ending, but the ending is in itself very lacking.  There were enough f-bombs to sink the Titanic, and the amount of time spent on pedophilia, drug addiction, rape, incest, adultery, teenage promiscuity, self-cutting, etc. don\'t serve much purpose in the novel.  Again I think Rowling just sat down one day and said to herself ""I bet if I write about all the crappiest things that happen in society, they will never say that all I write is children\'s books.""  Again if this is what she was thinking, she succeeded.  But I would have rather her goal to have been to write an awesome novel that doesn\'t need adult language and themes to make it sensational.'",2.0

You can easily turn this into a Harry Potter Prequel, for example, just by adding some budding wizardry and magic to the mix. A sort of what happened before the kids came to Mugwort. In fact, the story itself could be a Harry Potter book by just changing all the characters to magical fantasy ones. All the themes are still there, except no magic. So, when people say it\'s a big change I don\'t think so. Many of the catalysts in the plot lines are moved along by children. Life and death, good and evil, venal and carnal, petty and profound -- St. Michael stepping on evil, parental/adult power and chidren\'s reactions. And on and on.

As I made my way through the first two or three chapters, I was starting to feel really disappointed - there wasn\'t much in the way of off-the-wall creations or even action; we were just looking in on the day-to-day lives of normal (and in some cases downright dull) people. I actually put the book down for a day or two while deciding whether it was worth finishing. Not presuming to speak for anyone but myself, I have to wonder if this might be a common problem: we half expect to find ourselves reading something like a ""Harry Potter for Grown Ups"", and that is NOT what this novel is. It\'s almost the exact opposite of HP - where that series was all fantasy and invention, this book is a searing close-up on reality. And in the end, that\'s what kept me reading it. Rowling has an amazing sense of what motivates people, and a sadly accurate view of how often self-interest trumps the common good. Some reviewers have said these characters aren\'t likable, and I know what they mean - it\'s all but impossible to find someone to root for in this mess! Then again, if I\'m being honest, their imperfections and shameful faults made them more relatable to me. I HOPE I\'m not as morally bereft as some of the more pronounced villains who represent the extreme fringes of bad decision making, but the majority of these unlikable characters are just lost, or searching for they-aren\'t-sure-what, and taking wrong turns as they try to create a better life for themselves and their families. I felt sorry for them because I know how hard it can be to feel fulfilled, or how hard it can be to look yourself in the eye after at the end of the day. And that\'s only speaking of the individual characters - the larger storyline of the haves vs. the have-nots was equally sad, shameful,...and accurate.

One thing Rowling does better than many authors is really make you feel like you're just as involved in the story as the characters are.

The characters are mostly all insecure or unlikeable or hypocrites or just plain sad, but that's what makes this novel so great. It doesn't present any one perfect character but instead a bevy of very real people who are quite imperfect. They have the faults that many of us can recognize within ourselves or acknowledge in people we know (even if we turn a blind eye to it most of the time). I felt as though I knew all of the characters so very well by the end of the book, and yes, I hated some of them, felt nothing for a few, but had a good deal of sympathy or at least understanding for the rest. You know that something bad is going to happen, but you are kept guessing who it might happen to because so many of the lives in the small village of Pagford are so messed up and teetering on the edge of disaster. What does occur by the end of the novel forces certain veils to be lifted and certain truths to be exposed, causing some of the characters to change for the better while others go on being their same (if not more) unlikeable selves.

In fact, some of the teens are the same ages as the students her in other novels, but very worldly. It seems that in the whole town, not one family has a normal relationship and no one has a good parent/teen relationship.

But the reward for that is a deeper understanding of what it means to be a writer and what it means to be human. None of the characters in this book are necessarily likeable, but they are relatable. You can relate to Gavin's desire to say the things he wants, but also his inability to actually do anything about it. You can relate to the awkward sexual adolescence of Andrew, and the heart breaking dissatisfaction that Dr. Jawanda feels for Suckvinder. I've heard a lot of complaints about how dark this book is, but there was nothing portrayed in this book that I hadn't either experienced first hand or heard about growing up. Yes, the things that are spoken of in this book are horrible, but to pretend as if they don't happen is nave and unfair to Ms. Rowling as an author. It is obvious that she might have been trying a little too hard to write an adult novel, but if she had written anything less it would have been compared too closely to Harry Potter. The Casual Vacancy is a master piece in itself. Once you're introduced to the actual meat of the characters it's hard to put down, and you're left wondering how much you have in common with these people, and what that means for you. It makes you re-examine and also reaffirms what we tend to think of people. It describes a small town (much like my own) so well, that I felt like I had also grown up in Pagford. Yes, this book had a weak ending. And yes, it was a bit morbid and dark, but for her first novel since Harry Potter I was more than impressed and It has quickly become one of my favorite books.""",5.0

For my taste it didn't hold the reader's rapt attention in quite the same way and I actually felt it was embarrassingly too adult in places - it just felt wrong to hear that kind of foul language uttered by Rowling!  The plot was also very slow to develop and the twists were a bit too predictable.  I did enjoy the feeling that it was written for a distinctly British audience, requiring me to look up various slang terms & brand names - it was very much like being immersed in the English lifestyle even more so than we had been with HP Wizarding World.

Well......it just wasn't Harry Potter. I understand that she probably wanted to write something different than fantasy. 100 pages in, I just couldn't find much that was redeemable about it, and quit reading.  There was barely any story line. All I could gather was that a man named Barry Fairbrother had died, leaving a seat empty on the Parish Council.  There were a few lines of description that this man was trying to do some positive work to help the people who lived in the Fields, but that was it. Was this supposed to be the story? I don't know, there was too much vulgarity hiding it if it was. If JK Rowling had actually concentrated on writing about the work he had done for the Fields people, and the gap that he left behind in improving that community when he died, this would have actually been a great story. But......NO! Instead she had to spend pages and pages writing DISTURBING and VERY graphic sex scenes, using the F word as many times as possible, and as many scenes as possible involving drug usage.  This was just gross. If she was an unknown author, it wouldn't have bothered me so much, but........she's JK Rowling. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF WRITING MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!

I hear people relating their experiences with this all the time in my work and thought J.K. Rowling nailed it.

It seemed a mistake at first but as I continued to read I saw the tragedy of it unfold and also the deft and fairly believable way in which J K Rowling  resolved the gap left by the casual vacancy.  I was also  concerned that all the characters still alive were quite unlovable - the hero had died at the beginning.  However by the end I could see that his work might continue if not exactly as he had planned.  Overall it is a disturbing book in many ways and I couldn\'t get over the feeling that the author was determined to put her stamp on writing for adults in a rather heavy handed way.  I would have liked a range of characters rather than lots of unlovable ones and a very few with some saving graces.  That said, I felt that , like many of the characters who benefited from his actions, it was a pity that Barry had died early as he had obviously started to make some unhappy lives better.  Of course Pagford is really a metaphor for society  at large.  I would recommend this book to those who like serious themes, thoughtful characterisation and well written plots.

Unfortunately, for every positive the book offered, there are five negatives outweighing it. I simply did not like this book.

Then she decided she wanted to show everyone she was grown up, but goes way too far, and instead of coming off as mature and adult, it comes off as childish and completely inappropriate. The book had so much vulgarity and swearing, that it was hard to read. There were a few seriously disturbing scenes included as well. I couldn't enjoy the book.

All in all, it was very good, albeit depressing, however, it was steeped in reality.  The author excels at making you feel for the characters, some good, some bad, some downright pathetic.  The reasons I did not give it 5 stars were twofold: first, there was a point about midway through the book where it dragged a little and I started to lose interest, but it did pick up and the ending was very fast-paced.  I couldn't wait to finish it to find out what happened to the characters. Secondly, there were so many characters that there were times it was hard to keep track of them (especially on my Kindle; it's much easier to flip back to a pages in a book when you need to go back and check on something).

The characters in this book have been haunting me since I began reading it and I am finding it just as thrilling and exciting to re-read it.  This book is full of so very many people, deeply flawed, real people.  I have found something in common with each and every character, even the ones I didn't want to.  The book does not end well and nothing is settled but each and everyone of these characters has had their world flipped upside down and been forced to look more closely at their own lives, instead of trying to sustain themselves on the gossip of others in this small town.

Neither is magic, the supernatural, or tidy, happy endings. It\'s a social commentary on modern society, about how people interact, and about the ""authenticity"" of the folks that make up a community. It\'s a study of a microcosm that represents western attitudes on a macro level. It isn\'t whimsical, or sugar coated (the cover art of the book leads you to believe otherwise); JK actually swears which can be jarring at first, and she talks about sex (gasp).  People do ugly things to one another, think ugly thoughts, some characters are irredeemable, all are flawed.  I had mixed feelings about this book up until the first quarter of it.  The story telling is not as strong as her previous work, but her character exploration is intriguing. In the end, I found this book compelling.

Maybe it's worse when listening than when reading, but the constant gratuitous spewing of four-letter words was an assault on the ears.  So far it's been a pointless meandering book about mean, unhappy, ugly people with few to no redeeming qualities.  JK Rowling is good at putting words together, but a story, especially one this long, has to go somewhere.  I wouldn't want to know anyone in this book.

Rowling's Harry Potter books, so I was not biased by her themes or writing style from the immensely popular series. I kept seeing Casual Vacancy at the bookstore and had read and heard good reviews of the novel so I gave it a whirl. The book starts out with the death of a council member, Barry Fairbrother, from a small town called Pagford in England. His death affects the entire town where he lives in both positive and negative ways. It's hard to keep all of the townspeople straight in your mind for the first few chapters, but once you delve further into the book it's fascinating to see the chain reaction Barry's death has as it impacts more and more people's lives. Harry Potter fans be warned that there are some VERY adult themes in this book, it's NOT a children's/teen's book by any stretch of the imagination and it quite morbid at times. That being said, I enjoyed reading Casual Vacancy because all of the characters were so well formed that you felt you had a real understanding of who they are and could sympathize with the struggles they go through (even if they are totally foreign to the struggles you have in your own daily life). I would recommend this book and will definitely read Ms. Rowling's next adult novel.""",3.0
2012-12-23,R32RQ3OVCSEEOW,b'Book Smart',b'Disappointed',"b""First of all it would be hard to change genres after the success of Harry Potter. I wasn't sure what to expect after such a successful series of books that were so well-written and clean since they were aimed at a younger audience. Also I did not finish the book, I stopped after part I. Good things - some wonderful phrasing and descriptive passages; really insightful renderings of human nature. JK Rowling is so very talented and the Harry Potter books made so many youngsters into readers. It's always fun as an American to read from the British point of view, I am fascinated by the subtle cultural differences and words for things. Things that made me bail before the book was over, (which is extremely unusual for me) - all the way through part 1 I had hardly met a character who wasn't manipulative, selfish, predatory, promiscuous or abusive, to include the children. Although these characteristics are typical of the human race, you don't read a book to roll around in it, it just got to be overwhelming. There needs to be at least one character who is likable and decent enough so that the reader doesn't feel creepy stepping into their persona. Maybe the person who passed away filled this role and I didn't stick around for it, but after the last scene in part 1 I didn't have the stomach to continue. Also I agree with some of the other reviews that the characters were hard to keep straight, I had to review a couple times to figure out who was married or related to who. There were a lot of people introduced very quickly.""",2.0

It's also left with a plethora of candidates ready to fill his vacant seat, and that's when the fun, or the trouble, begins. Because the inhabitants of this little town, so warm and friendly to all appearances, have deep-seated resentments and agendas--rich hate poor, teenagers defy their parents, husbands and wives disagree violently, and teachers despair of ever teaching their students anything! This ia a black comedy, well-written and amusing, and if you admire J. K. Rowling of Harry Potter fame, you'll probably like this book, her first adult novel.

The writing is shockingly juvenile, choppy, and repetitive. It was actually surprising how poor the writing really was in a lot of places. It also just felt like Rowling was so happy to finally be able to use profanity, that she overused it, rendering it pretty much cliche. Ditto for sexual content. Both have their places in a good storyline, but sloppy overuse is just off-putting. It came across as trying too hard. The point of view within sections switched from character to character so quickly, it became impossible to know who was doing the speaking/thinking. The characters all seemed pretty one dimensional and cookie-cutter. The domineering family man who is also the town big shot. The teenager who can't stand his parents (this was overdone in multiple characters). The 'bad girl' with the heart of gold. Boy with crush. Woman unhappy in relationship. Mamma's boy. It goes on a little too long. The book never seems to figure out what it really wants to do. The plot, which is almost nonexistent, peters out way before the end of the book. We're introduced to this town and large number of its citizens, but we're never given a reason to care about them. The most dynamic character in the book is the guy who dies after the first few pages. I kept wishing this character was around because I didn't like any of the other characters. No one was sympathetic, no one was interesting, no one had any redeeming qualities (except maybe the dead man, Barry Fairbrother). A lot of the characters also did or said things that didn't seem to jive with the way the author described the characters earlier in the novel. At the end of the book, I breathed a sigh of relief that it was over, even though nothing really happened at the end. I mean, it did, but, like most everything else in the novel, the ending was rushed, unbelievable, and forced. I can only be thankful I borrowed this book from the library and didn't actually put out any money for it. I won't get back the time I spent reading, but what can you do?""",1.0

Except for the poor little toddler, who is horribly abused as all the adults in his life fail him, there is no one who seems to have any redeeming qualities. The british underclass is portrayed as criminal, drug addicted, foul mouthed and lacking any compassion or ounce of responsibility. The middle class denizens of the town do not fear much better. They are portrayed as greedy, crooked, selfish, child abusing folks. I could not really enjoy this novel, because it was so dreary, OTT incidents, rape, incest, ugly characters and no bright light at the end of this long slog of a novel. Husbands disliked wifes, wifes hated husbands, and the teens are hating almost everyone who is an adult. Could the author not have found one single human being in this fictional town, that I could admire or want to care about? J.K.

What it means to live, what it means to have hope, to love, to feel pain, to be ashamed etc. etc. There\'s no need for anything ""major"" to happen because life in itself is a series of celebrations and tragedies. It\'s hard to like any of the characters because we see what they think, but then again, it\'s hard to like anyone once we get a glimpse at what they\'re really like. It\'s simply humanity: we\'re not perfect, no one is. And so, Rowling is brutally honest about what society is really like. She plays with the way people perceive others and even the way, people perceive themselves. This book is proof of her great writing skills because by the end, I found myself really caring for some of her characters, even with all their imperfections. And isn\'t that one of life\'s biggest challenges? Learning to love others, learning to trust people even when we know that they will eventually fail us? Not all the characters change. Not all the conflicts are resolved by the end. It\'s more like Rowling captured one moment, one glimpse, in the much-less-than-perfect lives of the citizens of Pagford.'",4.0

I work in a data-entry, so I have a lot of time to listen to audiobooks. Once it came out, i got the audiobook and got through it in about 2 1/2 days. And its okay. Its not amazing by any stretch, but i wasn't really expecting it to be.

Of course the reader has to be willing to stay with the novel past its very confusing and uninviting start to get to the interesting character studies and darkly humorous main plot that centers around the pettiness of small city politics.  The book begins with the unexpected death of the saintly Barry Fairbrother who served on the town's parish council.  We are introduced to many of the townspeople through their reaction to his sudden passing and by the time of his funeral we have a pretty good understanding of the identity and foibles of the main players.  Parents and their teenage children are a major component of the book and J.K. Rowling shows the same understanding of the difficulties of coming of age that she did in the Harry Potter books. However THE CASUAL VACANCY is definitely a book written for adults or very mature adolescents as it is much more graphic in its depictions of some of the realities of life than the Potter books.

The town of Pagford, England, is peopled by Rowling with a wide-ranging assortment of characters, whose thoughts propel the story. I'm reminded of John Updike and early Stephen King (before verbosity took over), who are unsurpassed at getting inside their characters' heads. Some who didn't like this novel have complained that the characters were unlikable, that they had no redeeming qualities. I would ask these critics about the innermost thoughts of their own friends and neighbors, and even themselves. If we knew what everyone was really thinking, would we find them likable? Would we want others to know our own innermost thoughts? A writer does not operate under these constraints and is under no obligation make her characters user friendly.

Where it was hard to put the Harry Potter books down because we liked the characters so much, it is hard to keep reading The Casual Vacancy because we like the characters so little. What was fascinating to me was just how different the two worlds are that Rowling has created. Harry Potter is about good vs. evil, friendship, loyalty, self-sacrifice,  and survival on a grand scale.  The Casual Vacancy is about the life of a small village of no particular importance filled with dysfunctional people who are destroyed.  Most of the characters are petty and self-absorbed, doing what they think they need to do to survive regardless of the havoc it causes for someone else. There is shocking meanness in the book. There is disturbing, raw vulgarity and exploitative sex. There is no love, and almost no charity. Yet, to my surprise, I cried at the end.  The Casual Vacancy is in many ways the antithesis of the Harry Potter books.  As such it shows Rowling to have quite a range as a writer. I didn't enjoy reading The Casual Vacancy the same way I enjoyed reading Harry Potter, but I'm glad I read it.  It was thought-provoking.  There are 3, maybe 4, women who are admirable in the book,who try to help others.

This is a mature book that aims to some extent to strike at the literary fiction market. One gets the feeling that Rowling has somehow made a challenge to herself to write something that is significantly more challenging (to read) than anything else she has accomplished; the challenge in this case lies in the equivocal portrayal of people in ""TCV"". It\'s this subtle point, I think, that many one-star reviews have failed to grasp: the human psyche is complex and can\'t help what it thinks - people are not simply ""good"" or ""evil"". Of course I sympathise with the expectations of her fans and their adventurous excursion to non-fantasy realms (many of my friends who only have read fantasy have dipped their toes in other waters for the first time with this book), however one must not approach a book with your own prejudices - absorb and discard that which appeals to you or has truth to it.'",4.0

It is a masterpiece that propels JK Rowling into another dimension of artistry.  I am a huge fan of her Harry Potter series and was aware that this novel was a deviation from children\'s lit into a more mature direction.  It is gritty, realistic, profane, sadistic, deeply disturbing in parts.  It challenges the reader to understand the characters motives and not judge them only on their actions.  At it\'s core, it is a character study that totally engages the reader and makes you care about the outcome for each character.  This book inspires comparison to some of my other favorite authors, Roddy Doyle and even Barbara Vine (minus the mystery).  Tom Hollander\'s narration was perfect in every way.  His vocal gymnastics portrayed each character with it\'s own voice and personality.  I have contemplated some of the negative reviews on this site and wonder if these reviewers would have been so harsh had the author not had another book series that had such an impact as HP.  Some reviewers seem almost angry that Rowling would deign to ""turn over the rock"" of the human experience and explore the ugliest aspects of life.  However, after reading this book, one comes away with a deeper compassion for others who we may have judged unfairly.  One sees her profound respect for the teenage trial --the terror and humilation of the teenage years that as adults we slowly forget.  Rowling allows her characters to adapt and to change for the better or worse. This book has inspired me to be more compassionate toward others and less judgemental.'",5.0

Would you do anything at all? Would you just go past, not caring, because it's not your problem, not your fight? Would such circumstances make you crumble or rise? Would they bring out the worst or the best in you? I think that these are all very important questions and I applaud J.K. Rowling for raising them in such a brutal, honest way, not being afraid of using the language and the imagery that will appal and repel, showing the ugly side of life that so many of us pretend not to see, though it exists right next to us, and the inevitability of tragedy that comes from neglect, irresponsibility and abandonment. I think it took a lot of courage to write about all of this, knowing, as she did, that such a book would raise many objections, that its worth would be overlooked because of who she is, its language would be abused, its subject matter misunderstood and ridiculed. It made me cry. It broke my heart. But it gave me hope too. I know that the story didn't come to an end with the full stop.

Yes, I found it difficult to begin and to sustain through the first portion of the book. Yes, I found it immensely good after I got into it. I knew going into this novel it was not a children\'s book. I was also, for some reason, expecting a mystery type book (this isn\'t), and that, too was difficult to work through as I began to read the book on its own merit.  It is hard, though, to distance yourself from Rowling as Harry\'s creator and Rowling as the voice of Pagford. However, I really reminded myself that it was a different book with a different purpose and if I kept reading I would find something of merit. Was I ever right. I am amazed at Rowling\'s ability to distance herself from children\'s literature and write a very adult novel using very adult language and themes. It was a huge break from the past and one that took bravery and daring to write. I was also amazed at the development of the characters and the plot lines. Each character had a unique and distinct voice. I think what was difficult for me at first was keeping them all separate, however, once they are all introduced and you are moved between them and among them and introduced to each of them through the other characters, I was amazed at the intricacy with which it was written. As far as writer\'s craft goes, it is excellent. As the plot continues to unfold, Rowling continues to tie one person\'s observations and interpretations into another character\'s reality...and let me say...they are not always one and the same. Truly, things are not as they appear in Pagford, and the necessity of ""keeping up appearances"" hides a lot of pain and misery. No, it is not a happy book (although there are moments of lightheartedness and wit), but just because it is not happy and does not sugar coat reality does not make it any less compelling. It took me a long time to read it. I began in September when it came out and I just finished in mid-November. Mainly because the beginning was difficult for me to sustain. Once I determined I was going to go back to it, and got past all the introductions, it flew and I finished the remaining 2/3 in just a couple of days (my reading time is limited). If you are a Harry fan, please try to separate yourself from the other series. If you give the book a chance on its own merit, you may be surprised at how involved you become in empathizing with (or hating) some of the characters. I am convinced to go back and re-read the beginning, now that I am more in touch with the characters...I will enjoy it more the second time around. The 4 stars are because of the slow beginning.

When I first started reading the book I thought...""What the F?...""did she just say that?"" and ""we are not in Hogwarts anymore""...and it was quite slow at the start, however I pushed on, and as I kept reading I became more and more engrossed in the story. This is NOT a book for Kids! Sorry,  if that is what you were expecting,you are in for a huge surprise, and J.K.Rowling warned us all about it too. Nothing is ""sugar coated"" here. J.K. tells a gritty, risky, and at times disturbing tale, about the reality that is life in many places in the world. Though there where many moments and scenes that I (as a HP reader) could just not believe that this was the same writer of that magical books we all grew to love, however there were also many scenes where J.K. Rowling\'s humor and genius truly shines. She did not write this book purely for shock value or because ""she could""...she wrote it because she truly believed in her story, and in her characters. The book makes you think, it makes you have to see what potentially you might not be ready to see or swallow. This is one of the reasons I think many people find it off-putting. There are many things through out the story that could have happened to ourselves, or to people we know...ugly truths that most people don\'t want to face.

Why, you would ask. Because I love the way she writes. Classy and giving immense importance to details which not a lot of writers do. Even tiny details like what the character is eating gives a very personalized feel to the reader and practically takes him inside the book,as if everything is happening for real. But I guess my expectations were higher for this book. I expected a political story, as the name suggests, some dirty politics and an exciting climax. Till the very end I was hoping that something would happen which would make me think ""ooh i did not expect that"".

This proves she can write for adults even when the real focus of her story are the children, struggling through adolescence, vulnerable, and as agents creating the tragic story arc that leads to unpleasant truths, tattered relationships, self awareness, and death.  This  isn't hogwarts and the ending is bleak and unsettling.  Her individual portraits rival Sherwood Anderson's masterful collection of grotestiques that he created in Winesburg Ohio.  Each is sharply drawn and their fobiles and failures clearly drawn.  Krystal, of course, is the real and tragic heroine of the story.

I was excited to read this book, even knowing it was not about Hogwarts.  I was disappointed, but NOT because it isn\'t another Harry Potter.  The book is very dark and really a huge downer.  Harry Potter was often times dark and dealt with death.  However, the Harry Potter novels remained hopeful.  There was a light at the end of a tunnel and a continuing belief in the ultimate goodness in people.  I did not find any kind of hope in the Casual Vacancy and this is what bothered me the most.  Also, Harry Potter is full of memorable, likeable characters.  I did not find any of the characters here very likable.  A few I felt very sorry for (Krystal, Sukhvindar) but there were none I was really rooting for.  Most of the characters were desperately selfish and almost pitiful (like Samantha, Gavin).  All this said, Rowling is a tremendous writer.  Despite my dislike of the characters, I finished the book and found parts of it compelling.  I will qualify all this by saying I don\'t really read ""sad"" novels.  If that\'s your thing, you might like this.  I felt very blue after finishing the book.

I still found myself wanting to know what happened to the charactors but not so much thatI would call this a ""cant put you down"" book.

Well..in my humble opinion too few authors develop their characters, and she does a smashing job here :-) had to sound a tad British. You will recognize many of the characters in your families, friends, neighbors; I cared deeply for many, loathed quite a few, and feared for others. At one point, when you see what is going to happen, you will be shouting through the pages for characters to see what is right in front of them..as you would in a horror movie when someone is about to go off alone etc. Point of view is expressed beautifully...along with it denial, rationalization, and justification. She is depicting life, and despite it hitting close to home, and perhaps not the escape some Amazon readers want, I truly admire her writing for so, so many reasons.

By page 149, I thought good heavens, when is a PLOT going to happen. Rolling's talent is definitely with character development and I came to know them well and pictured them in my mind. The plot finally did unravel and at a fast speed, and the book was worth hanging on with. I always like to see a moral angle in a book and I was not disappointed. I certainly applaud Rolling for stepping into new territory and would support her in anything she does as many of us do. This book? Glad I read it, I would be very hesitant to recommend it without saying to other readers know that in my view, it's a long read with paydirt coming way down the line.

Rowling is a very talented author, and her style of writing is - as always - colourful and witty. The reason I gave this book three stars is becase it was so painful to read. Oh my god, it was painful. I am not the kind of person who puts down  a book, but about fifty pages into the book, I was filled with inexplicable hatred for everything in my life  - my friends, my family, even myself. It is amazing how manipulative this book can be. The absolute absence of even a hint of happiness within the characters and the plot is one of the reasons this book makes me rage for no apparent reason. That all of the people in this book have hearts of coal and reflect human selfishness in every aspect is another. I was seriously tempted to stop reading midway, because this book was ruining my mood and destroying my faith in humanity. After finishing, however, and looking back, this was actually composed pretty well. It had the touch of philosophy I value the most in books, and the vocabulary was splendid. I wouldnt recommend this book, but it still is a great item. Kinda like Damien except with a more pessimistic overlook.

The admiration for promiscuity ( the characteristic of her main  character) , the disdain for middle class virtues... The comparison of the obesity of  one of a major taxpayer in the community and the expense of the NHS to treat it with the expense of the treatment of a drug addict , made by an Indian GP!

About halfway through the book it got interesting with the ghost and as the ending came to a head the reader is interested to see if it will end as they suspect but other than those moments it is dull and depressing. Rowling does a good job describing people and situations but somehow the characters and events are not compelling enough. There is no easy solution to poverty, addiction, prejudice, or teenage angst and so the reader knows the book will not provide solutions to the key problems highlighted in the book. And so the reader is left feeling depressed at the parent-teen relationships (which are all bad to terrible in this book) and at the poverty, addiction, and prejudice. The book is useful in shedding light on this subject for those who are naive or not already familiar with the complexities of these issues but for those already daily familiar with these topics, it provides no satisfaction at all.

Just a caveat, that the first few chapters will throw out a lot of characters and back story.  Some books include a summary of characters, and that would have been helpful with this one to get all the players straight.  But about a quarter of the way through the book, everything starts blending together, and the political intrigue, plotting and conniving between the villagers build deliciously.  Almost everyone has an ax to grind, skeleton in their closet, or some petty self-serving motivation.  You may see yourself in some of the characters.  Due to adult subject matter and language, it is not suitable for children or teens in my opinion.  Many of the villagers grow a bit, some remain stagnant, and some come to a terrible end.

In this delivery, her amazing gift is her downfall. There are too many characters: multiple unlikeable families of age stepped, flawed participants who yell, scream, complain, whine, or moan their way through the chapters of the book. Most chapters are depressing and exhausting. This overly ambitious statement of contemporary life in the small, seemingly charming, English town of Pagford is neither kind nor uplifting. In many instances, the introduction of yet another ugly, grave, social issue made me want to stop reading. Woven throughout the lives of the Pagford inhabitants is the theme of class and caste preoccupation in it\'s very English way; by the middle of the book the town of Pagford, itself, has become an ugly character. This may be the most telling statement of all about contemporary English life. The book provides a rich tapestry of social issues in Pagford, and that feat is Rowling\'s genius. Unfortuneately, it does not translate to a compelling story. Too often, the story is repelling. As an avid reader of convincing yarns, I am disappointed in this effort.

I had to buy 3 copies of each of the 7 books in that series, one for each of my children, because they couldn\'t wait to dive back into the magic they knew they were about to experience.  After the first book came out, the remaining six found me camped out in a lawn chair and a sleeping bag with my kids waiting for Target to open their doors so we could race inside and grab the next installment.  Even as an adult these books blew me away with the depth and unfathomable imagination that Ms. Rowling possesses.  Which is why, when I heard she had authored a book for grown-ups, I absolutely could not wait.  I was now going to be able to experience the can\'t-put-it-down ride that children across the world had been enjoying for years.  I\'m telling you all this because this fierce expectation I had for an adult version of Ms. Rowling\'s talent may be part of the reason why I was so disappointed with The Casual Vacancy.  Or at least that\'s what I told myself as I was trying to come up with a reason to keep reading.  Certainly, I thought, it had to get better.  But sadly, it did not.  The first impression I had of The Casual Vacancy was that it seemed to be a poor imitation of Mauve Binchey\'s classic style, a collection of different characters that eventually came together at the end of an intricate but interesting story.  Unfortunately, the difference between these two authors is that Ms. Binchey\'s characters were fascinating, fun to get to know (even if they were evil) and her stories were often punctuated with a dry and unexpected sense of humor.  Totally delightful.  The characters in The Casual Vacancy were never really described in depth, possibly because by page 112 there were already 27 main characters.  I spent so much time flipping back and forth trying to remember who everyone was, who they were related to, and what their emotional handicap was, that I finally created a cheat-sheet of names.  However, by that point, I realized I had already lost interest in the entire book.  If you\'re a fast reader and can get through this novel fairly quickly I say go for it, if for no other reason than to see what Ms. Rowling has created.  But I highly recommend that as you start reading, you stick a post-it at the front of the book and jot down a brief description of each character as they are introduced, or feel free to print off a copy of what I typed up for my daughter, which I added as a hidden document entitled ""Roadmap"" on my webpage.  I pray that Ms. Rowling\'s feelings aren\'t hurt by the reviews this book has received, she is so obviously a kind and sensitive person, and so incredibly gifted.  And I truly hope she publishes another adult novel because I still adore her as a writer and a storyteller and would be the first in line to buy a copy.'",2.0

The descriptions, the characters, the plotting, the suspense was great fun. There was nothing of the sort in a Casual Vacancy. I had assumed that JK Rowling, who I greatly respect would write a murder mystery, or an adventure. It never occurred to me that she would write a novel with almost no plot, no adventure, no action, just as a study of a number of people, none of whom I cared about, all of whom were uniformly awful and involve them in a really boring effort to run for a boring office. A number of the characters died or had a misadenture and I didn't feel the least bit sad as they were all uniformly non sympathetic.

Yet, even in his most suburban novels, the characters were unique, the environment was suffused with a kind of underlying tension, and the stories were emotional adventures. This is never the case with this new book. The most touching character is Krystal, the welfare-class teenager who contends with a stupefied mother, a filthy environment, and a little brother who is infected from negligence. The other characters, (including the off-page Barry Fairweather who [spoiler] dies in the introduction) are mostly noticeable for their being annoying and narcissistic. The entire plot revolves around Fairweather\'s apparent charisma which is spoken about but never illustrated.

At this point, I stopped reading the book and returned it!  While I understand that this type of language and vulgarity is, unfortunately, prevalent in our society, I find it offensive and do not wish to hear or read it.  I am surprised that Rowling, with her writing skills and excellent command of the English language, could not find other words to describe these people and scenes.

This is Rowlings first attempt at writing for ADULTS and she did a phenomenal job. Why did people love HP so much? The original storyline? No. We\'ve all heard/read stories of good vs. evil our entire lives... no originality there.. It was her characterization and the connections she made within those characters. It\'s the familiarity of those characters that made you fall in love. Every single book-nerdy girl felt like Hermione at times or awkward boy felt like Neville... we related to the characters, not the story. And ""Vacancy"" does not fail in that aspect. Am I loving the storyline? Not entirely, but I knew I wouldn\'t by reading the synopsis... it\'s just not my ""style"" of story but she\'s sucking me in anyway. She makes me love and hate those characters because I KNOW them.. they exist in my neighborhood, just like they exist in yours.

Originally from the UK I understood the words that were uniquely British so I don\'t know what difference that made to readers who didn\'t know their meaning. I suppose because I read all the Harry Potter books that I expected a page turner with lots of action and vivid characters. This book has a small plot - a man dies leaving an empty seat on the town council that must be filled, and tells a slice of the lives of the people involved. There is no, or very slow, advancement of the ""plot"" and no action to speak of, although Rowling employs subjects that involve children, a cause near and dear to her heart I understand, including the dark issues of self-mutilation, rape, poverty, addiction, abuse, etc. These are all awful things that need to be addressed but I\'m not sure this is the proper venue, certainly not for me, or perhaps not in the way they were presented. A more intense and suspenseful story might have worked. I struggled hard to read this book in its entirety but perhaps that is because this is not the type of book I usually read.

JK has proven once more her immense capacity for character development and the complex inner workings of the desperately narcissistic psyches thriving in any community.  Having worked as both a community therapist and a school counselor in my own career, her descriptions of families and children at risk and those dealing with addictions were written so precisely as to feel like  real families on every street in every town.  The ego conflicts and complex weaving among the adults of her community also accurately reflect the human tendency to scapegoat the less fortunate and hide their sufferings from our own eyes because they too closely reflect our own hidden and feared pain.

The entire book I was expecting it to build to a big finish, which it did for the most part. This was full of social and political commentary told through the events in a seemingly normal small town.

At the heart of the tangle of lives is Krystal and Robbie Weedon and Barry Fairbrother\'s death was the beginning of the end for them too.  Husbands and wives, fathers and sons, all of their secrets are revealed and you just might recognize yourself in one of these oh-so-human characters.  There is no magic to make their lives more bearable (but magic never did that at Hogwarts either) and people learn that they must live with the consequences of their actions, or lack of action in some cases.'",5.0

There are more messed up teens and parents in this small town than seems humanly possible. If that\'s the point that everyone is a hypocrite and has a hidden agenda, then she made that point well. That being said, the writing was sharp, the intertwined lives of the characters well conceived, the depiction of the town was vivid, but I found that I had to will myself to finish the book, mostly because there are really no sympathetic characters in the whole lot of them. You end up alternating between feelings of intense dislike mixed with pity for most of the characters and that fact kept me from really enjoying the book. I feel like I survived a 3 day ordeal just by finishing. My conclusion is that JK Rowling is a very perceptive writer with a sharp grasp of people\'s character flaws, but deep down I wished she\'d touched upon some redeeming features of humanity.

This book is very much riding on observations of common human behaviors, which I thought at times to be brilliantly executed, and in the same breath, sometimes painfully cliche and stereotypical. In such a character-based story, I felt that the character layers and developments were to be crucial in telling it.'",3.0

However, I love to read books from many genres, and I was very well aware that ""The Casual Vacancy"" was J.K. Rowling\'s foray into a whole new world. I wasn\'t expecting wizards or magic or broomsticks or even humor. What I was expecting was a novel that wasn\'t super dull to read, and unfortunately  for me, that\'s exactly what ""The Casual Vacancy"" is, from start to finish: boring, boring, boring. And my goodness, how it DRAGS! Rowling\'s extremely vivid descriptions and characterizations were apparent in this book, but the problem is that all of the characters are basically selfish and one-dimensional, not to mention completely uninteresting. This book paints a dark picture of the lives of the residents who inhabit a small English town and come to blows over its politics, but there\'s nothing for the reader to really grab onto or care about, and the pacing of the story is unbelievably slow, especially for the first half of the book.'",3.0

If you can't handle seeing what really goes on in the lives of many sad souls this is not the book for you.  It is a look at the seamier side of life.  Rowling paints an accurate picture of what life is for many teens and adults in a small, rural town.  She captures their emotions brilliantly.  Is it depressing?  Yes.  Is it hard to read at times? Yes.  Is it a well constructed, deep piece of literature? Yes.  It is human emotion and raw need at its worst.  And it is very much like her Harry Potter books. They are dark and disturbing not light, sunny books either.  J K Rowling makes you feel strong emotions with her writing. She makes you think.  You need to look behind the story to see the real story she is telling. I had to come back and add to this review after continuing to read so many negative reviews. First- if you have not bothered to read the entire book please don't write a review - its not fair to the author. Second, if you bought this expecting Harry Potter that was your mistake not the author's. This book is clearly advertised as an adult fiction book. And finally, she did not write  a book about all of the inhabitants of a small town. She choose to write about a group that was bound together by a common  event /cause. That these people all had serious life issues they were dealing with was the setting of the book. Life is not always pretty.

I was very excited when I downloaded my copy to my Kindle and sat down to enjoy her work. The book is a sort of parable, as JK is fond of developing stories that operate on several levels.  At its most simplistic level, its about the death of a town council member and the ripple effects that death has on the members of his small community.  On another level it is a study of the politics and infighting of small town governance.  On yet another level, its a closer look at the inner workings of relationships rife with physical and emotional abuse, and the co-dependency that fuels these dysfunctional families.  And ultimately, it is a concrete demonstration of the evil that occurs when the village has no interest in helping to raise its neglected children.  Is it a happy story?  Not really.

I was hoping for a sharp, funny and insightful look at small town politics with its' real-life consequences. Instead, it was immediately evident that this story was another dark and morose tale of children being victimized by  cruel and dangerous adults, and in turn, victimizing each other. Ms. Rowling is adept at painting an exacting picture of the effects of cyclic poverty, substance abuse and child abuse that is apparrently as dire in the UK as it is in the US. She is also dead on at illustrating the chiasmic flaws in an ineffective and impotent child welfare system that is also apparrently as dysfunctional there as it is here. The last two chapters of the book were  the best, in my opinion. It left me crying, as a tragic ending will often do.

To complicate this process, she alternates from using their given names and their nicknames.  Unlike War and Peace, there is no list to help the reader remember who the characters are.

In all fairness I did pick out random pages throughout the book and read them only to find out that it felt like what I had read in the first 56 pages. The characters, like the book itself, are flat and uninteresting, the cussing and the sex seems like she is trying to say See I can write for adults, except you don't have to be vulgar and crass to make a book good. Maybe if Barry Fairbrother had lived the book would have been better. Rowling also said that she didn't write the book for her fans but more for herself....maybe she should have had bound just one and kept it on her bookshelf and saved us all from wasting our money. If she writes another book will I buy it? Maybe after I have read more reviews and not just because she wrote it expecting it to be great.

I'm an avid reader and certainly don't expect my novels to be nothing but sweetness and light, but this book is utterly unpleasant. It's a character-driven novel, but none of the characters are likeable or admirable in the least. This is not a story of good people fighting bad people; it's a story of disgusting, self-centered people interacting with other disgusting, self-centered people. The story jumps so rapidly from one character's POV to another's, I didn't feel invested in any of them; didn't know them; didn't care about them. I actually had to write notes to remember names -- who was whose son, wife, enemy, etc. There is very little plot; no causes or quests I cared about. It's filled with vulgarity in language, thought, and deed. I'd give it an NC-17 rating. I was ready to plow through the unpleasantness out of loyalty to Rowling, but realized around page 120 that, not only was I repulsed by these people, I was bored out of my mind. Rowling is a gifted writer, especially at describing people, personalities, and attitudes, but this novel is page after page of small, petty behaviors, not major actions that move the story forward. When one of the charcters started scratching his hairy navel, I decided I was done. I skipped and read the last two chapters, which were so depressing and pointless, I'm glad I didn't waste my time on the rest. So so so disappointing! Argh!

It is raw and painful; an insight into the struggles of people with no meaning in their lives beyond what is here and now.  J.K.

Harry Potter went through life at Hogwarts never once having to relieve himself or take a bath, but in this novel we get descriptions of every sort of nastiness out there.  The main characters were supposed to be the adults, but Rowling's teens are the driving force in this novel, as well as the source of most of the vulgarity and disgusting behavior.  Why is it that today's authors seem to feel the need to add vulgarity and smut to their work in order to be read?  The Casual Vacancy covers nearly all of humanity's ills in lurid detail.  I can fully understand drug abuse, pornography, teen sexuality, child abuse, infidelity, and pedophilia without being dragged into the back bedroom to witness it. The last third of the book told the same story without all of the x-rated descriptions that were shockingly present in the early pages.

There is no hero, no villain, in this book, but rather a small town full of characters of varying importance and qualities.  Their concerns could not be any more petty and unimportant to the greater world.  Everyone hates each other in The Casual Vacancy, and the most positive reaction I felt about any character was pity.

But by the time I finished it, I came to realize it was a bold, brilliant way to get us to think about the ""haves"" and ""have nots"" and how inside people\'s minds, daily thoughts and hearts they are all the same no matter which side of the tracks they live on.  Granted all of the people in this book were messed up, alhough Krystal and Kay did try to help others.  My guess is since the author has achieved unprecedented success, she has met people in high positions she would not have otherwise met and she has been unimpressed or even disappointed.  I think Rowling\'s bottom line is there are ""have not"" kids out there dealing with real problems such as drug addict parents and some of the people who appear to the be pillars of their towns, schools, etc. are not helping them because they fill their days with all of the nonsense/shortcomings we saw in the book.

Junkies, wife beaters, ambitious small-town politicians, despondent wives, and horny teenagers make up this cast.  Once everyone's intrigues are presented, the pacing slows down for the latter two-thirds of the book until the last 40-ish pages.

Despite being told again and again that this book would be nothing like the H.P. books, some people obviously expected something similar. I also think if you understand something about the British sensibility you will like it better too. I\'ve read lots of British authors works and if I had to compare her work to someone else\'s, I would compare it a bit to Faye Weldon\'s body of work. In my humble opinion, there is a greater divide between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" in England. Rowling (and Weldon) love skewering the upper classes high opinion of themselves. In The Casual Vacancy, the little town of Pagford wants to cut financial support for a drug clinic in the Fields, which lies between Pagford and Yarvil. Pagford fancies itself the quintessential quaint English village, they don\'t want the taint of the Fields associated with their town. Of course the fact that a lot of the people in Pagford have roots in the Fields is something they\'d all rather forget. Rather than realizing how lucky they were to escape the fate of most Fieldians and trying to help others improve their lot, they want to distance themselves from the people and problems of the Fields. It illustrates how quickly some people can forget where they came from once they get a little money. The biggest exception is Barry Fairbrother, who is from the fields, but lives in Pagford and serves on the town council and is trying to help one girl in particular, Krystal Weedon. Krystal is a perfect example of someone whose life could have gone either way. You get the feeling that if Barry had not passed away, Krystal may have had a chance. You see how easily someone can give up on themselves if no one else believes in them. I don\'t want to give anything else away but I think her characterizations are just a tiny bit caricatured but otherwise they seem pretty spot on. I hope Rowling writes many more books for adults and I hope she is not influenced by bad reviews to write fluff just to please people who\'d rather not have a glimpse at a side of life they\'d rather not know exists.'",5.0

And the horrible details of poverty, drug addiction and various kinds of abuse are all too familiar to anybody who reads the news.  In the last 10% of the book the plot finally started to move along, and some of the characters at the end did get to grow and change.  **SPOILER ALERT**--when certain characters died tragically I was actually relieved, as they had no future and were doomed from the start by the circumstances of their lives (and also the circumstances of the book--it was hard to see how they could sink much lower and this wasn\'t the type of book where they were going to get a happy ending).  One of these characters was the most sympathetic in the book and only in the last few pages were some anecdotes revealed that added to her humanity.  By the end I thought the author\'s point was probably to draw attention to the ways in which society fails its most disadvantaged children, and that in an interdependent world this has repercussions for people from other socioeconomic levels.

Sadly, this book did not come close to either of those experiences. As any Harry Potter reader knows, character development is not one of Rowling's strengths, and this is the fatal flaw of the book. The teenage characters are more finely wrought than the adults (as was true for the Harry Potter series) and there are a few of these teenagers who are engaging. I wish Rowling had either focused on the teenagers' stories more or developed the adult characters. The plot is mildly interesting and kept me reading through 2/3 of the book, but at that point, the fact that I did not care enough about the characters to continue reading overcame any vested interest I had in the story line. Finishing the book was a chore, and I found the ending to be wholly unsatisfactory. I hate when authors kill off characters because they cannot figure out what should happen next, it is an insult to the readers. If Rowling had spent some time developing some of the adult characters - there are two women in particular who could have carried the book - this might have been more successful. Alternately, instead of starting the book with the death of a man who appeared throughout the tale to be one of the few with any morals, Rowling could have started with his story and had him die later, which would have created an interesting pivotal point in the plot and tension in the story.""",2.0

That being said, I didn\'t expect this book to be anything like Harry Potter plot-wise, or even in theme.  I was super-excited about something completely new from J.K. Rowling.  Regardless of what anyone says of her prose in her previous series I always found something sparkling and intoxicating in her writing style and characterizations.  So I eagerly purchased the Casual Vacancy on the first day of its release, and launched into it like a child greedily rips open presents on Christmas morning.  If anything asserts the distinction that this is not Harry Potter or any other book for young readers its the immediate and excessive usage of loose profanity, rampant drug and alcohol abuse and sexual depravity.  We are launched into the mind of every single character we encounter at some point, viewpoints shifting back and forth dizzyingly.  This allows us a unique access to their thoughts and backstories, and this third-person omniscent is very contrary to the third-person limited we experienced in her series.  Being a lover of minute details and normative everyday activities and thoughts, I was prepared to love this in every way.  You have to understand how much it pains me to say that I don\'t think I do, I feel the need to love it, to defend Jo Rowling and all her brilliance, but I think it would be ""inauthentic"" of me to claim it.  To me it feels like there\'s something missing.  This book is so dark and gloomy and heavy, and perhaps its meant to be after years of writing good-natured comedy and happy endings.  However the heaviness is wearing, and I found myself returning relentlessly back to the book, not as I have to all her others in avid anticipation of what would happen next, but with a sense of duty.  Though the characters are not wholly uninteresting, there\'re all seriously flawed in one way or another (which may be more true to life) but which makes it difficult to really find any of them likable and sympathetic, though it gets easier towards the end.  Something I missed here too was Jo Rowling\'s talent to easily weave seemingly small, but vastly important details into the story and keep them hidden there for later discovery and impact.  She does much less vivid a job creating a physical world for us under the assumption we can just see the small town without fresh and fruitful descriptors, and as a result the town seems flat, the homes nearly indistinguishable.  For me, the spark was missing, and throughout at least 90% of the novel I could scarcely believe it was authored by J.K. Rowling.  And though I\'m sure she\'s intentionally moving away from and editting her writing so it doesn\'t match Potter, the attempt to redefine seems to rob some of the best qualities of Jo Rowling\'s writing.  Overall, it\'s okay, not completely unenjoyable, has some really poignant and heartfelt moments, but definitely isn\'t for everyone and won\'t inspire the cult following of her previous series; which may have been Jo\'s intentions all along.'",3.0

Rowling takes her time masterfully shaping and delineating each character, creating a characteristically intricately plotted story which weaves the lives of at least twenty people into a varied, lively tale of the every day.

It was not long before the characters' lives exposed themselves for what they were or for what they were to become, humour being overtaken by the stark reality of gloom and doom. This was to be the focus of the much larger part of the book and  made the book as a whole seem out of balance. The endless, sordid and squalid misery in the lives of the over-ample sufficiency of characters presented me with nothing beyond my awareness of life for some people.

Without his empathy and intervention, everything goes from bad to worse in Pagford in this very grown-up novel from Rowling, who proves herself a very able writer indeed in this realistically depicted tragedy of modern-day politics and class antagonism. I found this book entirely engrossing, with well rounded characters with mostly believable obsessions and hang-ups [though for my taste Colin, or ""Cubby"", the deputy schoolmaster, was a little too Wing Biddlebaum for me to quite believe]. I was impressed that Rowling was so very in control here not just of her sentences [I only spotted one real clunker] but of her excellent imagery and tone. Her bleak view here is entirely intentional, as her last-minute leavening of an otherwise unremittingly tragic ending with a well told reminiscence shows us. And what is she trying to show? Well, when the little tike who fantasizes about the speed of real cars by saying, ""Broom! Broom!"" [in a quick nod to Harry\'s Nimbus 2000] meets such a sad final fate, Rowling is clearly letting us know that our magic-free world can only be improved incrementally and through the faltering efforts of rightminded individuals like the much missed Barry, so much do we depend on each other, despite all our flaws. Change is hard, so we need empathy to cut through our own vacancy and apathy and spur us to help, even when such help seems even less than pointless given the enormous weight of suffering on the one side and the forces of social injustice aligned to protect the status quo on the other.'",5.0

The characters in this novel have nasty little secrets and the death which opens the story serves to reveal their many flaws. All of this makes Rowling appear more cynical and less humorous than in the Harry Potter series, and the book did start to feel very dreary about one third through. But I soldiered on, confident that the feeling of being in the hands of an excellent storyteller I had enjoyed during the opening pages would pay off. And it did. The resolution, while tragic, was satisfying and the changes that characters exhibited were believable and touching. I think her characters rang true and even though their lives were rather sordid, I didn't feel that the book itself was. It made for an engrossing, thought-provoking read.

2012-09-29,R2M2T4B6D53XYL,b'A. Prentice',b'A Very British Novel; A True Heroine',"b""This is a novel in a very English tradition; it has echoes of Dickens, of George Meredith, of Evelyn Waugh. Post-World War II, it has notes of John Mortimer's Paradise Postponed and more than a few hints of Martin Amis. Rowling sets her nominally political tale about a local concil election in a setting that contains both the beauty of a traditional English village - Pagford - and the grit of an industrial city - Yarvil - inextricably linked, as the history of England includes the green and pleasant lands and the dark Satanic mills. She people both towns and tells the interwoven tales of many families, contrasting the middle class and the poor. What is unique about this book are the combined voices of the teenagers who inhabit it: Krystal, Andrew, Sukhvinder, Fats, and Gaia. These are young people struggling to survive and find a way to successful adulthood - some will make it and some won't. While Rowling can be somewhat humorous in portraying the imperfect adults in this novel, she is serious about the children and depicts them with knowledge, empathy. The most poignant character is the most desperate, Krystal Weedon, who came to remind me in many ways of Bill Sykes' Nancy. She is a true English heroine for modern times. The conversations of flawed parents and their desperate children are gripping and memorable. I cried at the end of this book and I'm not sure at all why reviewers are calling it a black comedy.  The images of Krystal and her young brother Robbie at the end of the book will stay with you for a long time. HIghly recommended.""",5.0

There is no magic here to offer any hope of change, no wizard to sweep down and offer aid, either to the characters or to the reader, and as the action progresses, with its focus on the unpleasant and often violent aspects of many lives, the reader is forced to examine the elements of chance which can devastate everything that one might dream of.'",3.0

A gritty version of ""It\'s a Wonderful Life"" set on a street much like Privet Drive, it is a challenging book.  Yes, it is a tragedy, foreshadowed from the beginning, but elaborate plot twists are not the point.  The point is the characters.  You won\'t like them at first, and you are not meant to.  Rowling unveils the way in which we are all cabined off from compassion by our own self-centered dramas.  She takes you on a journey of your own failings, and it\'s a cruel and unfortunately accurate journey.  But then she surprises you with compassion, even for some of her most unlikeable characters, even for you.  For example, this sentence:  ""How awful it was ... the way tiny ghosts of your living children haunted your heart; they could never know, and would hate it if they did, how their growing was a constant bereavement.""  All she asks is that you have the compassion for others that she has shown for you.  You finish the book with a series of ""if onlys,"" because so many of the characters have the chance to avert tragedy, and fail.  If only, you can\'t help think, Hagrid was there, with his pink umbrella -ella -ella.  But this is the real world, and somebody like us has to rescue the boy under the stairs.  Rowling doesn\'t leave us without hope, however.  As in the original ""It\'s a Wonderful Life,"" you also finish the book with an indelible sense of what one imperfect person CAN do.'",4.0

Not really my kind of fiction, I read fiction to STOP thinking about the depressing inequalities and unhappy endings in real life. (Slight spolier) I knew there was going to be a suicide in the book from reading reviews. I found myself wondering which character it would be (there are over 20 characters whom we get point of view from, maybe over 30) but not particularly caring too much. It was one of the top 5 I suspected, tho the triggering event was a bit of a surprise it was predictable many pages before the triggering event happened. Folks DO need to go in prepared, one thing I didn't see mentioned in reviews was that one of the characters is a cutter. This, plus the POV portrayals of spousal and child physical abuse and rape could be very triggering for some folks. Being inside the mind of a character while they are slicing up their arm with a razor blade if you are a recovering cutter (or other self-mutilation behavior) could be a very bad thing is my concern. I finished the book feeling like I had just sat through a really rough time with a friend who was just really awakening to the horrible disparities in society and hadn't really found their footing & hope for the future yet. It is not an optimistic book, and there weren't any characters I really connected with - none of them felt at any point like people I would really want to sit & have a cuppa with if I knew even as much about them as the other characters did. Might be a really good book for folks thinking of going into social work or community activism to read though. Depressingly accurate portrayl of that from my experience. I suspect a lot of this was JKR trying to process & come to terms with her own kids being teens/young adults in the socioeconomic situations she's been in, etc, and her trying to understand why some of these horrible things happen in the world where she doesn't see any humans as pure saints or pure evil.""",4.0

Much to her credit the author does this with sharp comic wit, however it does all go on a bit too long with the ending being somewhat predictable and heavy-handed. It goes from being a lively comedy of manners to over-wrought slog by the end. I will say that I did enjoy her attempt to combine cutting comedy with social commentary.
