    "#### Identify the Problem:\n",
    "    Many students want to earn entry into the UCLA graduate school program and want to know what they can do to achieve that feat.  There are many variables that a graduate program uses to determine who they grant admission to and usually it is a combination of things like GPA, test scores, previous experience, and pedigree.  The problem is determining which ones matter more and which ones matter less. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Goals of the Research:\n",
    "    The goal of my research is to find trends or patterns using historical data on previous applicants.  The four variables we will analyze are GPA score, GRE score, prestigious background of the candidate and whether or not they received admission or not.  The research will depend highly on the quality of the data gathered.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Data Analysis:\n",
    "    I've collected data on 400 applicants some of which earned entrance and some who did not.  The data is specific because the variables we used are straight forward as admittance is a binary variable of whether or not the student got in or not.  GPA and GRE are standard scores which are quantifiable.  The prestigious background is classified as 1,2,3, or 4 with 1 being the highest and four the lowest.  The data is measurable and I assume that the 400 samples I have are a good representation of the larger population of applicants to the program.  The data is well suited for me to attain the desired outcomes of my analysis.  The time period for which the data was collected is unknown and this could be a problem determining if the sample we received is good.  But I am going to operate under the assumption that the data received from the instructor is in fact quality data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Questions:\n",
    "    Does having a higher GPA help you get into school?\n",
    "    Does having a higher GRE score help you get into school?\n",
    "    Does coming from a prestigious background help you get into school?\n",
    "    Is it more important to have a higher GPA or a higher GRE Score?\n",
    "    Does having a prestigious background really matter?\n",
    "    What is the minimum GRE and GPA score accepted into the program?\n",
    "    What is the average GRE and GPA score accepted into the program?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploratory Data Initiatives:\n",
    "    Initially I will obtain descriptive statistics on my variables which will include, mean, median, mode, histogram diagrams, box plots, distribution analysis, and correlation analysis.  Once I've come up with those, I will start looking for trends and running regression analysis.  \n",
